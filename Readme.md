# Vara [![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/huboh/vara)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/huboh/vara) [![Build Status](https://github.com/huboh/vara/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/huboh/vara/actions/workflows/go.yml)

`Vara` is a powerful dependency injection framework for building modular, maintainable and testable Go applications.

## Features

- üöÄ Zero-configuration dependency injection
- üîí Type-safe dependency management
- üì¶ Modular architecture with clear boundaries
- üåê Built-in HTTP routing and middleware
- ‚ö° Lifecycle management for application components
- üõ°Ô∏è Flexible guard system for request authorization

## Core Concepts

Vara is built around four fundamental concepts:

- Modules: Organizational units that encapsulate related functionality
- Dependencies: Services and components managed through dependency injection
- Controllers: HTTP request handlers with built-in support for guards, filters, interceptors and middlewares
- Lifecycle Events: Hooks for managing application and component lifecycles
